# Grocery-Store

A simple text-based grocery shopping simulator written in Python using VS Code. This is my first Python project, created to help me learn how Python handles user input, functions, loops, and conditionals. Python 3 installed. No external libraries required.

Features

- View grocery items and prices
- Add items to your cart
- Checkout with randomized card decline logic
- Handles invalid input and recursive selection
- Simulates payment outcomes

To run the project:

```bash
python Grocery-Simulator.py
```
