# Grocery-Store

A simple text-based grocery shopping simulator written in Python. This is my first Python project, created to help me learn how Python handles user input, functions, loops, and conditionals. Python 3 installed. No external libraries required.

Features

- View grocery items and prices
- Add items to your cart
- Checkout with randomized card decline logic
- Handles invalid input and recursive selection
- Simulates payment outcomes

To run the project:

```bash
python Grocery-Simulator.py
```
